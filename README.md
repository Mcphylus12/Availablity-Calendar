The idea is mine but i thought I'd get AI to crack out the actual site as its small and writing vanilla JS is a pain

I zero backend tool for finding free dates in a group. 
- A leader loads the page and then creates a range of months.
- They can then share the url to members who fill in days they **Arent** available
- Once filled it in the url will update and can be imported into each others calendars to build a complete calendar representing when everyone is busy
